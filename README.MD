■What your page does

● Functions as a pseudo-CV, with skills represented graphically and work experiences below. Portfolio of represented in a carousel with images and modals for descriptions.

■ Challenges faced and how you overcame them

● Had no prior exposure to HTML, CSS or Javascript. Was unsure how to implement DOM manipulation, so I opted to write a Javascript code that checks for empty fields in the contact page. If any are empty, it will prompt users to fill them.

■ Links/sources to code references, if any

● The only source code references I used were from Bootstrap documentation, for Navbar, Tabs, Carousels, Modals etc.
