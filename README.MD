■What your page does

● Functions as a pseudo-CV, with skills represented graphically and work experiences below. Portfolio of represented in a carousel with images and modals for descriptions.

■ Challenges faced and how you overcame them

● Had no prior exposure to HTML, CSS or Javascript. Was unsure how to implement DOM manipulation, so I opted to write a Javascript code that checks for empty fields in the contact me section. If any are empty, it will prompt users to fill them. Also faced some issues deploying the site on Heroku as it doesn't support HTML deployment. Had to include a PHP file to redirect the site to the HTML file automatically. 
Also tried different design choices but in the end I preferred the clean white site. 

■ Links/sources to code references, if any

● The source code references I used were from Bootstrap documentation, for Navbar, Tabs, Carousels, Modals etc.
